- ðŸ”­ Currently I am working on creating [Deep Learning GUI v0.1.3](https://prashant9316.github.io/Deep-Learning-GUI-beta/) which can be found on this [repository](https://github.com/prashant9316/Deep-Learning-GUI-beta), where you can host your Deep Learning Models without server. Want to become the person to test it out??
